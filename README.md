# Tic-Tac-Toe

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! It's not optimized for mobile devices (but i think i did a decent job with the unit of measurement - CLAMP function, it's usable on mobiles) and no frameworks were used.

TODO:
- Add the possibility to do against an AI (MINIMAX algorithm)
- Could rewrite/clean up the code
